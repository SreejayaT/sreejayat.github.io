### Machine Learning | Deep Learning | Transfer Learning | Vision Models

Passionate about the space where research meets real-world applications. With a background that blends science, data, and AI, I explore how machine learning and deep learning can turn complex information into meaningful insights.
Always curious, always learning, and always open to conversations about AI, applied research, and innovation.



## About
With a foundation in science and hands-on experience in machine learning and deep learning, I work across the ML lifecycle—from dataset creation and preprocessing to CNN and hybrid CNN–Vision Transformer modeling, training, and evaluation—emphasizing reproducibility and careful experimentation.

I’m interested in applied ML and research-driven roles that bridge theory and deployment, and I’m open to opportunities as a Machine Learning Engineer, Applied Researcher, or Data Scientist focused on real-world impact.
