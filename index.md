## Projects

### Disease Detection in UAV Imagery
**Problem:** Identify diseased regions in orthomosaic imagery  
**Data:** Multispectral UAV images  
**Method:** Subplot extraction, CNN / ViT models  
**Result:** Binary classification of healthy vs diseased regions 

### Smart Weather Gradio
 - Built a gradio interface that takes input weather data and outputs messages or warnings for the given data.
 - Used automated data retrieval from live API calls and visualized (Requests, Geopy, Pandas and Matplotlib)
